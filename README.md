# Max Diamond

   A bootcamp assignement to make a PacMan type game in Javascript. I chose a different character, Max Diamond.

Max goes to the most dangerous places in the world in the pursuit of gathering diamonds. From the jungles of the Amazon to the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, he's been everywhere, seen everything.

Now Max has one of his toughest challenges at the Tomb of the Zombie Mummy! Dark, damp stone walls. Rats, zombies and mummies. Max has to face them all if he wants to gather all the treasures this tomb has to offer.
